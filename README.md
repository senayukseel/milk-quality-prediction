# Milk Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of milk based on several input features such as **pH**, **temperature**, **taste**, **odor**, **fat content**, **turbidity**, and **color**. The dataset used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle** and consists of multiple attributes that describe the quality of milk. The project implements several machine learning and deep learning models including **ANFIS**, **ANN**, **Linear Regression**, **Deep Learning**, and **Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)** to build predictive models for milk quality classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Milk Quality Prediction** dataset from Kaggle. It contains the following features:

- **pH**: Acidity level of the milk.
- **Temperature**: Temperature of the milk in Celsius.
- **Taste**: Categorical variable (Good/Bad).
- **Odor**: Categorical variable (Pleasant/Unpleasant).
- **Fat**: Fat percentage in the milk.
- **Turbidity**: A measure of the milk's clarity.
- **Colour**: Categorical variable representing the color of the milk.
- **Grade**: Target label, which indicates the quality of the milk (High, Medium, Low).

## Models

Several models have been implemented and tested to predict the quality of milk:

- **ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System)**: Combines fuzzy logic and neural networks to predict milk quality based on input features.
  
- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**: A fully connected neural network built using multiple layers for learning patterns in the dataset.

- **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model to predict milk quality as a continuous variable based on the input features.

- **Deep Learning**: A deep neural network with multiple layers and activation functions to capture complex relationships in the data.

- **LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization)**: A supervised learning algorithm that helps classify milk quality by learning prototypes from the data.

## Key Insights

This project has taught me how to apply various machine learning and deep learning algorithms for classification based on multiple features, and it provided valuable insights into how different models like **ANFIS**, **ANN**, and **LVQ** perform depending on the structure and complexity of the data.
